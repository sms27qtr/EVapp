If the growth experienced in the past\n            two years is sustained, CO2 emissions from cars can by 2030 be put\n            on a pathway aligned with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)\n            Scenario. However, electric vehicles are not yet a global\n            phenomenon. Sales in developing and emerging economies have been\n            slow due to the relatively high purchase price of an electric\n            vehicle and a lack of charging infrastructure availability.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div>\n            <h2>Country and regional highlights</h2>\n            <p>\n              China, Europe and the United States remain the leading electric\n              vehicle markets Countries and regions making notable progress to\n              advance electric cars include:\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  Norway continues to lead in rates of electric vehicle (EV)\n                  deployment, with the share of electric car sales reaching 88%\n                  in 2022.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  China accounted for nearly 60% of all new electric car\n                  registrations globally in 2022.

The growth in electric car sales took place in the context\n              of globally contracting car markets: total car sales in 2022\n              dipped by 3% relative to 2021. Electric car sales - including\n              battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric\n              vehicles (PHEVs) - exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative\n              to 2021. In the course of just 5 years, from 2017 to 2022, EV\n              sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It\n              previously took 5 years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow\n              from around 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential\n              nature of EV sales growth. In the Net Zero Scenario, electric car\n              sales reach around 65% of total car sales in 2030. To get track\n              with this scenario, electric car sales must increase by an average\n              of around 25% per year from 2023 to 2030. For comparison, electric\n              car sales increased by 55% in 2022 compared to 2021.\n              Electrification is happening in other vehicle segments, though in\n              2022 the electric sales share of buses and trucks was only around\n              4% and 1%, respectively.
