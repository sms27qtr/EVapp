Then you can easily take the help of fast chargers or even\n          battery swapping services if you are on a two-wheeler on the road.\n        </p>\n        <h2>No noise pollution</h2>\n        <p>\n          Electric vehicles have the silent functioning capability as there is\n          no engine under the hood. No engine means no noise. The electric motor\n          functions so silently that you need to peek into your instrument panel\n          to check if it is ON. Electric vehicles are so silent that\n          manufacturers have to add false sounds in order to make them safe for\n          pedestrians.\n        </p>\n        <img src={NNP} alt=\"\" />\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n};\nexport default Benefits;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAClD,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAClD,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAClD,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAClD,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,mCAAmC;AACpD,OAAOC,EAAE,MAAM,iCAAiC;AAChD,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAClD,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,kCAAkC;AAClD,OAAO,gBAAgB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AAExB,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EACrB,oBACEH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,eACEJ,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACtBJ,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,EAAE;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACfJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAA6B;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtCT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAQH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACxBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAmB;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5BT,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;UAAAD,QAAA,gBACrBJ,OAAA;YAAKU,GAAG,EAAEnB,GAAI;YAACoB,GAAG,EAAC;UAAE;YAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;UAWH;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAG,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAoB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7BT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAMH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;QAAKU,GAAG,EAAElB,GAAI;QAACmB,GAAG,EAAC;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAuB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAChCT,OAAA;QAAKU,GAAG,EAAEjB,GAAI;QAACkB,GAAG,EAAC;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAKH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAA0B;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACnCT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAKH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;QAAKU,GAAG,EAAEhB,GAAI;QAACiB,GAAG,EAAC;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAA8C;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvDT,OAAA;QAAKU,GAAG,EAAEf,IAAK;QAACgB,GAAG,EAAC;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACzBT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAiBH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAA6C;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtDT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAMH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;QAAKU,GAAG,EAAEd,EAAG;QAACe,GAAG,EAAC;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACvBT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAA+B;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxCT,OAAA;QAAKU,GAAG,EAAEb,GAAI;QAACc,GAAG,EAAC;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MASH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAkB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3BT,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAOH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJT,OAAA;QAAKU,GAAG,EAAEZ,GAAI;QAACa,GAAG,EAAC;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAE,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACrB;EAAC,gBACN,CAAC;AAEP,CAAC;AAACG,EAAA,GAjHIT,QAAQ;AAkHd,eAAeA,QAAQ;AAAC,IAAAS,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
