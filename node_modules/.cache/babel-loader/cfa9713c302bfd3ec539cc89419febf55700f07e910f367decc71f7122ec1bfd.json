That is a\n              waste of around 80%. Fully electric vehicles have zero tailpipe\n              emissions, but even when electricity production is taken into\n              account, petrol or diesel vehicles emit almost 3 times more carbon\n              dioxide than the average EV. To reduce the impact of charging\n              electric vehicles, India is ambitious to achieve about 40 percent\n              cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil\n              fuel-based energy resources by the year 2030. Therefore, electric\n              vehicles are the way forward for Indian transport, and we must\n              switch to them now.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <h2>Electric Vehicles are easy to drive and quiet</h2>\n          <div className=\"detail\">\n            <p>\n              Electric vehicles don't have gears and are very convenient to\n              drive. There are no complicated controls, just accelerate, brake,\n              and steer. When you want to charge your vehicle, just plug it in\n              to a home or public charger. Electric vehicles are also quiet, so\n              they reduce noise pollution that traditional vehicles contribute\n              to.\n            </p>\n            <img src={DQ} alt=\"\" />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <h2>Convenience of charging at home</h2>\n          <div className=\"detail\">\n            <img src={CCH} alt=\"\" />\n            <p>\n              Imagine being at a busy fuel station during peak hours, and you\n              are getting late to reach your workplace. These problems can\n              easily be overcome with an electric vehicle. Simply plug your\n              vehicle in at your home charger for 4-5 hours before you plan to\n              go. If you are able to get a charger where you park at home, it is\n              very convenient to plan your journeys in advance. What if you\n              forget to plug in your machine someday? Then you can easily take\n              the help of fast chargers or even battery swapping services if you\n              are on a two-wheeler on the road.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <h2>No noise pollution</h2>\n          <div className=\"detail\">\n            <p>\n              Electric vehicles have the silent functioning capability as there\n              is no engine under the hood. No engine means no noise. The\n              electric motor functions so silently that you need to peek into\n              your instrument panel to check if it is ON. Electric vehicles are\n              so silent that manufacturers have to add false sounds in order to\n              make them safe for pedestrians.\n            </p>\n            <img src={NNP}
