The growth in electric car sales took place in the context\n              of globally contracting car markets: total car sales in 2022\n              dipped by 3% relative to 2021. Electric car sales - including\n              battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric\n              vehicles (PHEVs) - exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative\n              to 2021. In the course of just 5 years, from 2017 to 2022, EV\n              sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It\n              previously took 5 years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow\n              from around 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential\n              nature of EV sales growth. In the Net Zero Scenario, electric car\n              sales reach around 65% of total car sales in 2030. To get track\n              with this scenario, electric car sales must increase by an average\n              of around 25% per year from 2023 to 2030. For comparison, electric\n              car sales increased by 55% in 2022 compared to 2021.\n              Electrification is happening in other vehicle segments, though in\n              2022 the electric sales share of buses and trucks was only around\n              4% and 1%, respectively.

The use of EVs displaced around 0.7 Mb/d (1.3 EJ) of\n              oil in 2022. EVs would need to displace around 8 Mb/d (17 EJ) of\n              oil in 2030 to be in step with the Net Zero Scenario.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img
