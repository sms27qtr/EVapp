Recent years have seen exponential growth\n            in the sale of electric vehicles together with improved range, wider\n            model availability and increased performance. Passenger electric\n            cars are surging in popularity - we estimate that 18% of new cars\n            sold in 2023 will be electric. If the growth experienced in the past\n            two years is sustained, CO2 emissions from cars can by 2030 be put\n            on a pathway aligned with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE)\n            Scenario. However, electric vehicles are not yet a global\n            phenomenon. Sales in developing and emerging economies have been\n            slow due to the relatively high purchase price of an electric\n            vehicle and a lack of charging infrastructure availability.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div>\n            <h2>Country and regional highlights</h2>\n            <p>\n              China, Europe and the United States remain the leading electric\n              vehicle markets Countries and regions making notable progress to\n              advance electric cars include:\n              <ul>\n                <li>\n                  Norway continues to lead in rates of electric vehicle (EV)\n                  deployment, with the share of electric car sales reaching 88%\n                  in 2022.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                  China accounted for nearly 60% of all new electric car\n                  registrations globally in 2022.

The growth in electric car sales took place in the context\n              of globally contracting car markets: total car sales in 2022\n              dipped by 3% relative to 2021. Electric car sales - including\n              battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric\n              vehicles (PHEVs) - exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative\n              to 2021. In the course of just 5 years, from 2017 to 2022, EV\n              sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It\n              previously took 5 years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow\n              from around 100 000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential\n              nature of EV sales growth. In the Net Zero Scenario, electric car\n              sales reach around 65% of total car sales in 2030. To get track\n              with this scenario, electric car sales must increase by an average\n              of around 25% per year from 2023 to 2030. For comparison, electric\n              car sales increased by 55% in 2022 compared to 2021.\n              Electrification is happening in other vehicle segments, though in\n              2022 the electric sales share of buses and trucks was only around\n              4% and 1%, respectively.

Today, lithium-ion batteries\n              account for almost the entire EV battery market, and most of the\n              common chemistries rely on the critical minerals lithium, cobalt\n              and nickel. In 2022, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries - the\n              only lithium-ion battery chemistry which does not use nickel or\n              cobalt - reached their highest market share of the past decade, at\n              just under 30%. This was in part due to price volatility of\n              battery metals, making LFP batteries more attractive despite their\n              lower energy density. Supply chains for sodium-ion (Na-ion)\n              batteries - currently the only viable lithium-free battery\n              alternative - are also being established, with over 100 GWh of\n              manufacturing capacity operating or announced. The Na-ion battery\n              developed by China's CATL is estimated to cost 30% less than an\n              LFP battery, however, the current energy density of these\n              batteries is lower than that of even the least energy-dense\n              lithium-ion batteries.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <div>\n            <h2>Supporting infrastructure</h2>\n            <p>\n              The number of public charging points is increasing, but deployment\n              must accelerate\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <img src={vcp} alt=\"\" />\n            <p>\n              While most charging demand is currently met by home charging,\n              publicly accessible chargers are increasingly needed in order to\n              provide the same level of convenience and accessibility as for\n              refuelling conventional vehicles.
