Cleaning it up, and replacing it entirely where\n            possible, should be a main near-term policy goal for the United\n            States. Federal and state policy can help. Low-carbon fuel standards\n            require fuels become cleaner over time. And “carbon intensity”\n            tracking could ensure that what oil we do use doesn't get dirtier.\n            Policies that support electric vehicles (EVs) are also critical;\n            electricity is a cleaner fuel than oil, even when it's generated\n            from the dirtiest power grids. As the grid continues to transition\n            to clean energy, electric cars and trucks will become even cleaner.\n            Subsidies, incentives, and other solutions that get more EVs on the\n            road are a critical pathway for cutting carbon emissions.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <h2>Other policies</h2>\n          <p>\n            The transportation system is large, complex, and involves many\n            different authorities and interests.

Other important transportation solutions include\n            everything from increased investment in mass transit, to standards\n            governing smog-forming pollutants, to local and state-level policies\n            on the responsible deployment of ride-hailing services like Uber and\n            Lyft.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n};\nexport
