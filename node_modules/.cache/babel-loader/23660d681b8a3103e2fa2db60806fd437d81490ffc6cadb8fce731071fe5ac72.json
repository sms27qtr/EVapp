Today, lithium-ion batteries\n              account for almost the entire EV battery market, and most of the\n              common chemistries rely on the critical minerals lithium, cobalt\n              and nickel. In 2022, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries - the\n              only lithium-ion battery chemistry which does not use nickel or\n              cobalt - reached their highest market share of the past decade, at\n              just under 30%. This was in part due to price volatility of\n              battery metals, making LFP batteries more attractive despite their\n              lower energy density. Supply chains for sodium-ion (Na-ion)\n              batteries - currently the only viable lithium-free battery\n              alternative - are also being established, with over 100 GWh of\n              manufacturing capacity operating or announced. The Na-ion battery\n              developed by China's CATL is estimated to cost 30% less than an\n              LFP battery, however, the current energy density of these\n              batteries is lower than that of even the least energy-dense\n              lithium-ion batteries.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"statisticContainer\">\n          <div>\n            <h2>Supporting infrastructure</h2>\n            <p>\n              The number of public charging points is increasing, but deployment\n              must accelerate\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"si\">\n            <p>\n              While most charging demand is currently met by home charging,\n              publicly accessible chargers are increasingly needed in order to\n              provide the same level of convenience and accessibility as for\n              refuelling conventional vehicles.
